# Project-OpenDIVA

An open-source port of the game Project DIVA by SEGA

## Purposes

This project aims to be a clone of Project DIVA but with maps provided by the community. To reach this goal, the maps will be formatted in JSON and the project will use SDL2 for video rendering, audio, gamepad support and more features offered by SDL2.

The background scene will consist of a video, image or a real-time rendering (Vulkan is imo the best hardware accelerated rendering engine. For 3D rendering, suggestions are welcome, but I'm working on a 3D engine using boost::qvm and Vulkan).
