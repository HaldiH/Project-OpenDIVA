# Project-OpenDIVA
An open-source port of the game Project DIVA by SEGA

## Purposes

This project aims to be a clone of Project DIVA but with maps provided by the community. To reach this goal, the maps will be formatted in JSON and the graphics library will be Qt (because it is cute).

The background scene will consist of a video, image or a real-time rendering (MMD being an option, or using Qt3D with OpenGL).
